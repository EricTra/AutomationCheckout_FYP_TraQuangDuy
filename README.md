# VPayGo - AI-Driven Automated Checkout System

## üåü Project Overview
VPayGo is an AI-powered autonomous checkout system designed for retail stores and convenience stores. This system leverages advanced computer vision and real-time weight measurement to streamline the shopping experience by enabling customers to scan, weigh, and pay for items independently, reducing checkout times and improving operational efficiency.

#### REMEMBER CONFIG JETSON NANO OPERATION & JETSON NANO WITH EDGE IMPULSE  BEFORE SET SUP ENVIROMENT: https://developer.nvidia.com/embedded/learn/get-started-jetson-nano-2gb-devkit | https://docs.edgeimpulse.com/docs/edge-ai-hardware/gpu/nvidia-jetson

### 2. Setting Up Hardware

1. **Jetson Nano**: Connect the Logitech C270 Camera and configure GPIO pins for the load cell and HX711 module.  
   (Please follow the wiring diagram below.)

**Loadcell & HX711 Wiring:**
- **F+** (Red)
- **E-** (Black)
- **A+** (White)
- **A-** (Green)

**HX711 to Jetson Pin Mapping:**
- **GND**: Ch√¢n 6
- **DT**: Ch√¢n 38
- **SCK**: Ch√¢n 40
- **VCC**: Ch√¢n 2

2. **HX711 Calibration**:
   - Run the calibration script:
     ```bash
     python calibrate.py
     ```
   - Follow the on-screen instructions to calibrate the load cell with a known weight.
